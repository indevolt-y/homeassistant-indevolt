"""Load the integration source from this repository for focused tests.

Coverage goal: Ensure focused tests execute the current repository source, not
another installed copy that may exist in the environment.
Implementation: Construct the custom_components.indevolt package inside the
pytest process and execute the repository-root entry point.
Proves: Relative imports and tested objects come from the source under review.
Does not prove: This loader does not represent the complete HA lifecycle or
prove behavior on a physical device.
"""

# Reason: The repository root is not a standard importable package directory, so
# the package must be constructed from a file path.
# Usage: spec_from_file_location defines the package entry point and
# module_from_spec creates the corresponding module object.
# Impact: The module exists only in the current pytest process and is not installed
# into the system Python environment.
# Reason: A dynamic package must be registered in sys.modules and needs a minimal
# parent-package object.
# Usage: sys stores the package registration and ModuleType creates the
# custom_components parent namespace.
# Impact: This changes only memory in the current test process; it does not
# overwrite files or affect a running HA instance.
import sys
from importlib.util import module_from_spec, spec_from_file_location

# Reason: Test commands may start in different working directories and cannot
# rely on a relative current working directory.
# Usage: Derive the repository root and __init__.py from conftest.py's fixed path.
# Impact: This only resolves local paths; it neither reads nor modifies directories
# outside the repository scope.
from pathlib import Path
from types import ModuleType

# Reason: Package registration, the spec, and test imports reuse the import path
# and package name.
# Implementation: Define the repository root and standard HA package name once to
# prevent different literals inside the loader helper.
# Impact: This constrains only the test load location and does not change the
# runtime installation directory.
