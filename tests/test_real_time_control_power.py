"""Verify the Gen2 10800 W input boundary and prevent BK/write-path regressions.

Coverage goal: Check the Action, number, YAML, shared constant, and non-target BK
boundaries together.
Implementation: Use parametrization, fakes, monkeypatching, and configuration
parsing to verify call order, payloads, and zero-write behavior.
Proves: Both Gen2 integration entry points agree at the 10800/10801 W boundary.
Does not prove: The tests do not connect to an HA instance or physical device and
cannot prove physical output or command readback.
"""

# Reason: The test must parse the repository's services.yaml read-only without
# depending on the process working directory.
# Usage: Derive the repository root from the test file and read the service
# configuration for consistency assertions.
# Impact: This reads only the current repository file and does not modify runtime
# configuration.
from pathlib import Path

# Reason: Tests need minimal ConfigEntry, ServiceCall, and runtime_data stand-ins.
# Usage: SimpleNamespace gives fake objects the attributes accessed by production
# code.
# Impact: This provides only test attribute containers and does not replace the
# full HA lifecycle or physical-device acceptance testing.
from types import SimpleNamespace

# Reason: The suite needs asynchronous cases, parameter matrices, monkeypatching,
# and exception assertions.
# Usage: Pytest drives representative values, out-of-range values, and BK
# regression matrices across both entry points.
# Impact: It drives only fake objects and triggers no network or device side effects.
import pytest

# Reason: YAML cannot import the shared Python constant directly and must be
# checked independently after parsing.
# Usage: safe_load reads the selector for comparison with Python descriptions and
# the existing BK boundary.
# Impact: This validates only configuration structure and does not change
# services.yaml.
import yaml

# Reason: The product contract requires out-of-range requests to return the
# standard HA validation error.
# Usage: pytest.raises asserts both the error type and the 10800 W error message.
# Impact: This is used only for test capture and does not change production
# exception handling.
from homeassistant.exceptions import ServiceValidationError

# Reason: Copying handler logic would let tests diverge from production behavior.
# Usage: Call the real _register_services, capture its actual closure, and verify
# write ordering.
# Impact: Registration targets FakeServices and does not write to a running HA
# instance.
from custom_components.indevolt import _register_services

# Reason: A 10801 W request must fail before registry access, so the reference
# actually used by the production module must be observed.
# Usage: Monkeypatch async_get with either a fake or a failure sentinel.
# Impact: The replacement applies only within one test and does not modify the
# production module file.
from custom_components.indevolt import dr as device_registry_module

# Reason: Checking NUMBERS_GEN2 alone does not prove that setup selects it for
# both target models.
# Usage: Call the real number.async_setup_entry and replace entity construction to
# collect the selected descriptions.
# Impact: This replaces only entity construction in the test and creates no HA
# entities.
from custom_components.indevolt import number as number_platform

# Reason: The Action, number, and YAML must be reviewed against the same 10800 W
# source of truth.
# Usage: Assert the constant directly and use it as the expected selector and
# entity-description value.
# Impact: This only reads the constant and does not change runtime state.
from custom_components.indevolt.const import MAX_REAL_TIME_CONTROL_POWER

# Reason: The tests need the real Gen1/Gen2 descriptions and entity setter to
# avoid reimplementing the production contract.
# Usage: Select the actual power_setting description and call the
# IndevoltNumberEntity setter directly.
# Impact: FakeAPI replaces the API, so no physical point 47016 write occurs.
